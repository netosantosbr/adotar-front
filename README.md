# Adotar: Facilitating Animal Adoption

Adotar is an innovative project that emerged from the need to find a solution to the persistent problem of animal adoption, especially cats and dogs, in various cities where the lack of an efficient public policy hinders resolving this challenge. This initiative aims to create a network that streamlines the adoption process by effectively connecting people who wish to adopt a pet with those seeking a new home for their animals.

## Project Description

The Adotar API was developed using TypeScript and React JS, leveraging the robustness of these technologies to create a powerful and user-friendly platform. Through this APP, animal owners who wish to donate their pets and individuals interested in adoption can register and interact in a simple and intuitive manner.
